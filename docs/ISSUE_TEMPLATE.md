The guide below provides the flow for creating a perfect issue report to the Telegram X Repository. Before submitting, ensure that it complies with the following principles. 

## Your report must be:
- [ ] **Appropriate**. Only *bugs* can be included.
- [ ] **Structured**. Stick to the following path:
1. Use `'Copy Report Details'` from the app's Settings;
2. Include the public message link for reports involving media;
3. Attach a screenshot or video that clearly represents the issue in your report. Kindly change the app's language to English before recording those; 
4. A brief description of *Expected* and *Observed* behavior must be provided;
5. APK source is included – Google Play Store or another app market, Telegram Channels, etc.
- [ ] **English** is the only language accepted.  

## Your issue must not be a:
- [ ] **Feature Request**. Designers are welcome to propose properly crafted feature requests via [Telegram Designers](https://t.me/designers) or share ideas in [Telegram X Developers](https://t.me/tgx_dev), given they include *finalized* mockups and match the overall app quality.
- [ ] **UX Preference**. We won't consider those as issues. If you are a developer and believe some change would improve user experience on all devices, consider submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/TGX-Android/Telegram-X/blob/main/docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

*All these mentioned above will be declined.*
 
## A note on device-specific issues:
Specific issues you can reproduce on your end can be caused by the device itself and be device-dependent. Such issues do not mean to occur for everyone. Please be patient with those – fixing such issues can be time-consuming. 

Good luck, and thanks for the contribution!
