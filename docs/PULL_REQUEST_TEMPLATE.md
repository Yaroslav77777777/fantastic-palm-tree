The guide below provides the flow for creating a perfect pull request to the Telegram X Repository. Before submitting your PR, ensure that it complies with the following principles. 

## Perfect PRs must be:
- [ ] **Rational**. Explain the changes you've made. Be explicit and describe the changes in a few short, concise sentences.
- [ ] **Completed**. All changes are properly tested and ready to be merged.
- [ ] **Up-To-Date**. Your PR is based on the **latest** commit of the `'main'` branch.

## When fixing issues, make sure that your PR is:
- [ ] **Sufficient**. Changes must fix the cause of an issue, not its effects. 
- [ ] **Separated**. Different bug fixes are divided into independent PRs.
- [ ] **Linked**. If you fix a specific issue, add it to the title and its description to the body.
- [ ] **Creating**. The fix does not break anything in other interfaces or on specific devices. 
- [ ] **Consistent**. Use the proper design relevant to the issue. If the design is missing, the PR must include at least two screenshots (before and after the changes).
 
## When adding features, expect:
- [ ] **Discussion**. If you implement a feature that requires a new design for the app, be ready to receive and follow comments or edit suggestions.
- [ ] **Dismissal**. If the feature design you submitted is below our expectations, if it cripples the UX, or the feature-to-user impact is minor, your PR will be declined. All the features must strictly follow the Telegram X flow â€“ matching the overall quality, stability, and the general style of the app.

## Other contributions:
PR types not mentioned above can be considered as well, provided they are **rational**. For example, optimizations of existing features or the app build time (for this, before/after timing is mandatory). For code refactoring, the code should be **clearly** improved/simplified/more convenient and is expected to be free of any edge-case bugs.

Good luck and thanks for the contribution!
